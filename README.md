# Play platform

## What it is

The play platform is web app development made as simple as possible (but 
no simpler).

The platform provides an editor, built in automatic version control 
and collaboration, continuous live preview, offline development, 
importing code from npm or github, and a build and deployment system.

You provide code in the languages of your choice, and the platform turns 
them into the forms that browsers understand, with no configuration 
needed.

As you develop, you get instantaneous feedback. Every change you make is 
saved, and can be replayed from any point in time.

If you publish your development session, other people can watch you code 
or collaborate with you.

When you are done, click a button in the development environment to 
deploy onto a server.
